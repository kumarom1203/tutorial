5 Business simulation - Games and business simulation games 1 Partly, the terminology of business simulation games is not well established. The most common term used is 'business game' but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html

7 Business simulation - Games and business simulation games 1 Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html

14 Business simulation - Scenario simulations 1 In a business game or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to role-play simulations. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html
15 Business simulation - Numeric simulations 1 Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html
16 Business simulation - Types of Business Simulation Games 1 Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs,Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 23-35 which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html

20 Construction and management simulation - Business simulation games 1 Business simulation games are a subset of CMSs that simulate a business or some other economy. These games typically involve more management than construction. Rather than investing in physical buildings, construction can be abstract, such as purchasing stocks. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html
21 Construction and management simulation - Business simulation games 1 Active development of Internet technologies and the growth of the Internet audience in recent years gave a powerful impetus to the development of the industry of online games, and in particular, online business simulations. There are many varieties of online business simulations—browser-based and downloadable, single-player and multiplayer, real-time and turn-based. Among the most notable online business simulations such as Virtonomics, IndustryPlayer and Tycoononline. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html

25 Business acumen - Business Simulations 1 A business simulation is another corporate development tool used to increase business acumen. Several companies offer business simulations as a way to educate mid-level managers and non- financial leaders within their organization on cash flow and financial-decision- making processes. Their forms can vary from computer simulations to boardgame- style simulations. https://store.theartofservice.com/the-business-simulation-toolkit.html
